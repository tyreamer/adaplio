This must feel like a 2025 SaaS app: clean, minimal, beautiful, mobile-responsive, and professional.
Avoid “enterprise admin dashboard” vibes. Prioritize human warmth + sleek modern design.

Secondary Accent (Growth & Vitality): Teal #00BFA5 (for progress states, health cues).

Lighter Neutral (Cleanliness & Space): Warm Light Grey #F5F5F5 (backgrounds, cards).

🧩 Empty States

No Trainer (Client):

➕ Button: “Add Trainer”

No Plans Assigned:

“Your trainer hasn’t assigned a plan yet. Once they do, it will appear here.”
Illustration/graphic placeholder.

No Progress Yet:

“Your progress will show here once you log your first exercise.”

📱 Responsiveness

On mobile:

Hero collapses to card with avatar + name + progress ring.

Tabs convert to bottom nav or top scrollable segmented control.

Cards stack vertically with larger tap targets.

✅ Deliverables

Update Profile.razor (and related components) to implement the above structure.

Create reusable components: ProfileHero.razor, ProfileTabs.razor, ProfileCard.razor.

Apply theme tokens consistently (DesignTokens.cs).

Ensure dark/light theme compatibility.

Include sample dummy data for testing empty states, trainers, plans, and progress.
