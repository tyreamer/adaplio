 1. LocalStorage Operations - HIGH PRIORITY

  Location:
  - AuthStateService.cs:147-181, 223-253
  - ThemeService.cs:44, 90, 103

  Duplication: Both services implement identical localStorage wrapper methods:
  - localStorage.getItem
  - localStorage.setItem
  - localStorage.removeItem

  Issues:
  - Duplicate error handling patterns
  - Same try-catch blocks in both services
  - No centralized localStorage abstraction

  Consolidation Opportunity: Create a LocalStorageService
  public class LocalStorageService
  {
      private readonly IJSRuntime _jsRuntime;

      public async Task<T?> GetItemAsync<T>(string key)
      public async Task SetItemAsync<T>(string key, T value)
      public async Task RemoveItemAsync(string key)
  }

  Estimated Effort: 2-3 hours

  2. HTTP Authorization Header Management - MEDIUM PRIORITY

  Location:
  - AuthStateService.cs:183-191
  - Potentially repeated in other HTTP services

  Duplication:
  - SetAuthorizationHeader() and ClearAuthorizationHeader() patterns
  - Bearer token handling logic

  Consolidation Opportunity: Create an HttpClientAuthExtension or inject token management into HttpClient through DI

  Estimated Effort: 2 hours

  ---
  3. OnInitializedAsync Patterns - HIGH PRIORITY

  Location: Found in 30+ components/pages
  - Every page calls AuthState.InitializeAsync()
  - Repeated auth state checking patterns
  - Similar component initialization flows

  Common Pattern:
  protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
  {
      if (!AuthState.IsInitialized)
      {
          await AuthState.InitializeAsync();
      }
      // Additional initialization...
  }

  Consolidation Opportunity:
  - Create a BasePageComponent with common initialization
  - Use a global initialization service in App.razor
  - Implement component base classes

  Estimated Effort: 4-6 hours

  ---
  4. Authorization Checking Patterns - MEDIUM PRIORITY

  Location:
  - AuthorizationService.cs:18-166 - Multiple similar permission methods
  - Repeated IsAuthenticatedAsync(), IsClientAsync(), IsTrainerAsync() calls

  Duplication:
  - Every permission method has identical auth state checking
  - Similar validation patterns for role-based permissions
  - Repeated business rule structures

  Consolidation Opportunity:
  - Use attribute-based authorization
  - Create base permission classes
  - Implement policy-based authorization

  Estimated Effort: 3-4 hours

  ---
  5. Error Handling Patterns - MEDIUM PRIORITY

  Location: Throughout services and controllers
  - AuthStateService.cs - Multiple identical try-catch blocks
  - ThemeService.cs - Repeated error handling
  - Controllers have similar exception handling

  Common Pattern:
  try
  {
      // Operation
  }
  catch
  {
      // Ignore errors or log
      return null/false;
  }

  Consolidation Opportunity:
  - Create error handling middleware
  - Implement common error handling decorators
  - Use global exception handlers

  Estimated Effort: 3-4 hours

  ---
  6. Component State Management - LOW PRIORITY

  Location: Profile components
  - Similar loading states (_isLoading, _isSaving)
  - Repeated form validation patterns
  - Common data fetching patterns

  Consolidation Opportunity:
  - Create reusable form base components
  - Implement state management abstractions
  - Use shared component libraries

  Estimated Effort: 6-8 hours

  ---
  7. API Response Handling - MEDIUM PRIORITY

  Location: Throughout frontend services
  - Similar JSON deserialization patterns
  - Repeated response validation
  - Common error response handling

  Consolidation Opportunity:
  - Create API client abstraction
  - Implement response wrapper types
  - Use HTTP client extensions

  Estimated Effort: 4-5 hours

  ---
  ðŸ“Š Priority Recommendations

  Immediate (Next Sprint):

  1. LocalStorage Service - Most duplicated, easy wins
  2. OnInitializedAsync Patterns - Affects many components
  3. Authorization Patterns - Security-critical redundancy

  Medium Term:

  4. Error Handling Standardization
  5. HTTP Client Management
  6. API Response Patterns

  Long Term:

  7. Component State Management Refactoring

  ðŸ’¡ Quick Wins Available:

  - Extract LocalStorage service (2-3 hours, high impact)
  - Create BasePageComponent for auth initialization (3-4 hours, high impact)
  - Consolidate authorization checking methods (2-3 hours, medium impact)

  The most critical redundancies are in the authentication and localStorage patterns, which are used throughout the
  application and create maintenance overhead.
