Task: Implement P5 (Progress & Adherence) for Adaplio.

### Backend (Adaplio.Api)
- Endpoints:
  - POST /client/progress { exerciseInstanceId, status, notes? }
    → insert ProgressEvent
  - GET /client/progress/summary (per-week adherence %)
  - GET /trainer/clients/{id}/adherence
    → returns adherence % per week for that client (no raw logs)
- Rules:
  - Adherence = (# completed / # planned) per week
  - Respect consent_grant scopes: trainers can only view summaries if client granted view_summary
  - Use HOLD_FACTOR field in ProgressEvent to weight partial completion
- Update DbContext, add migrations if needed.

### Frontend (Adaplio.Frontend)
- Client pages:
  - "Log Progress" page → simple form to mark exercise complete/skip + notes
  - "My Adherence" page → weekly chart with % (MudBlazor chart)
- Trainer pages:
  - Extend client list to show adherence % summary

### Docs
- Update README with curl examples for progress logging + adherence queries.
