Task: Refactor the Blazor + MudBlazor frontend for Adaplio to feel like a premium 2025 SaaS app.

1. Layout & Spacing

Replace dense grid layouts with breathing room & whitespace.

Use a 2-column layout on desktop (content + contextual panel), stack on mobile.

Cards should feel lightweight, not heavy containers: rounded corners (20px), subtle shadows, increased padding.

2. Visual Design

Backgrounds: Dark Charcoal #1E2837 base, lighter grey cards #F5F5F5 in light mode.

Hero Gradients: Smooth diagonal blends (charcoal → teal, charcoal → orange). Avoid harsh blocks.

Card Aesthetic: Glassmorphic/translucent effect for modern feel.

Typography: Inter/Poppins — headings at 20–24px, sublabels at 14px grey.

3. Dashboard (Clients Overview)

Client list = primary focus. Each client should be a wide row card with:

Alias + name + scope badge (pill).

Progress ring + adherence % prominent.

Last activity in muted subtext.

3-dot menu for actions (instead of inline buttons).

Remove clutter: notifications, proposals, quick actions → move to drawer menus or top-right icons.

Top bar: “Invite Client” button styled as pill CTA with orange accent.

Add a subtle summary banner: “5 Clients · 83% Average Adherence” with teal highlight.

4. Profile (Trainer/Client)

Hero Card:

Large circular avatar with progress ring.

Name + role badge.

Gradient header with floating CTA (“Invite Client” / “Add Trainer”).

Tabs: Overview · Plans · Progress · Settings → styled as pill navigation (Linear.app style).

Overview Tab:

Left card: Client Statistics (big numbers, teal/orange highlights).

Right card: Recent Activity feed (timeline style, with icons for Completed / Missed / Pending).

Replace flat table look with timeline feed (avatars + event chips).

Plans Tab: Grid of plans with status badge + progress bar.

Progress Tab: Minimal chart with XP streak gamification hints.

Settings Tab: Card-based toggles (Notifications, Privacy, Account).

5. Interactions & Motion

Hover states: lift cards slightly, glow accent border.

Progress rings: animate on load (smooth 1s sweep).

Tab transitions: slide/fade for modern flow.

Add subtle microcopy in empty states (“Your recovery journey starts soon 🚀”).

6. Consistency

All icons in nav = line icons, no bulky filled icons.

Use consistent pills & chips (Summary / Private / Completed / Missed).

Stick to 3 highlight colors: Orange (action), Teal (positive/progress), Red (#E74C3C) for errors.

Deliverables

Refactor Clients.razor → minimal card list, action drawer.

Refactor Profile.razor → gradient hero, timeline activity, tabbed layout.

Add ClientCard.razor, TimelineEvent.razor components for reusability.

Apply new theme tokens in DesignTokens.cs.
