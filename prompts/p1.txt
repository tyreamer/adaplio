You are my coding assistant inside a new GitHub repo for a .NET + Blazor project.
Create the following structure:
/src
/Api (ASP.NET Core 9 minimal API)
/Frontend (Blazor WASM PWA with MudBlazor)
/Jobs (Azure Functions/Containers stubs for media pipeline)
/Shared (shared DTOs/domain primitives)
/infra
docker-compose.yml (mailhog only for now)
devcontainer.json + .devcontainer/Dockerfile
/.github/workflows/ci.yml
/README.md


Include:
- .editorconfig, .gitattributes, .gitignore (VS + node + python)
- Solution file Adaplio.sln referencing all projects
- Add MudBlazor to Frontend, set Poppins or system font, dark/light toggle
- PWA enabled with service worker + offline cache for basic routes
- In docker-compose: mailhog: latest, with ports exposed
- README with quick start: `dotnet run` (SQLite), MailHog URL
