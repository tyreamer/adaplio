Task: Redesign the Trainer "Clients Overview" page in Blazor + MudBlazor to match a 2025 minimal SaaS aesthetic.

Color System:

Primary Accent: Energetic Orange #FF7A00 (calls to action, highlights).

Core Neutral: Deep Charcoal #1E2837 (base backgrounds, text emphasis).

Secondary Accent: Teal #00BFA5 (positive states, charts, subtle highlights).

Light Neutral: Warm Light Grey #F5F5F5 (background, card surfaces).

Redesign Goals:

Declutter: Remove side-widgets from main page (Notifications, Recent Proposals, Quick Actions). Tuck them into a slide-out panel (accessible via top-right bell & plus icons).

Focus on Clients: Make the client list the hero of the page. Each client should be displayed in a wide card row with:

Alias + display name

Adherence % with a clean progress ring

Scope (summary/private) as a small subtle pill

Last activity timestamp

Minimal action button (three-dot menu → "View Details", "Send Proposal")

Navigation Simplification: Keep sidebar slim with icons + tooltips. Use the orange accent only on active nav item.

Typography: Use Inter or Poppins, larger headings, and lighter sub-labels.

Modern Layout:

White/light grey card backgrounds

Rounded corners (border-radius: 16px)

Drop shadows subtle (Material 1dp–2dp)

More spacing between cards (whitespace is key)

Notifications & Proposals:

Notifications: move to a bell icon in top nav → dropdown.

Recent Proposals: collapse into "Proposals" section in sidebar or modal, don’t keep inline.

Quick Actions (New Proposal, Upload Video): move to floating + FAB button bottom-right.

Deliverables:

Update Clients.razor to reflect this streamlined layout.

Create reusable ClientCard.razor component for each client.

Move Notifications and Quick Actions into MudBlazor MudMenu or MudDrawer (activated via icons).

Apply new design tokens and theme consistently across this page.

Ensure responsive layout (on mobile, cards stack, sidebar collapses to bottom nav).
