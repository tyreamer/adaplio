Make onboarding patient-first with three entry methods.

On public landing, show Scan QR, Enter code, and Text me the link.

If URL has ?invite= token, skip the landing and start validation.

Scan QR opens camera, scans a URL, and proceeds as if the link was tapped.

Enter code validates a short code, then shows trainer identity and continues.

Text me the link collects a phone number, sends the invite link via SMS, and shows a confirmation.

For all paths, if the user isnâ€™t authenticated, show lightweight auth (Google/email/passkey), then accept the grant and route to Weekly Board.

Hide all trainer-only controls when signed out; show Invite Client only for authenticated trainers.

Use an opaque, time-limited, single-use token; no PII in the URL/QR.

Provide clear errors and retry; track which method was used (QR/code/SMS) for analytics.

Keep component/file choices up to you; fit into the existing codebase and theme.
