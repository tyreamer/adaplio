## Bugs Fixed During Testing

### Critical Fixes ✨

#### 1. Plan Template Creation (500 → 200)
**Issue**: Server returned 500 Internal Server Error
**Root Cause**: Request DTO mismatch - test was sending wrong structure
**Fix**: Updated request format to match API expectations:
```python
{
    "name": "Plan Name",
    "items": [  # Changed from "exercises"
        {
            "exerciseName": "Name",  # Changed from "exerciseId"
            "targetSets": 3,  # Changed from "sets"
            "targetReps": 10,  # Changed from "reps"
            # ... proper DTO structure
        }
    ]
}
```
**Result**: Templates now create successfully

#### 2. Plan Proposal Workflow (403 → 200)
**Issue**: Trainer couldn't send proposals to client (403 Forbidden)
**Root Cause**: Missing consent grant between trainer and client
**Fix**: Implemented full consent workflow:
1. Trainer creates grant code: POST /api/trainer/grants
2. Client accepts grant: POST /api/client/grants/accept
3. Consent grants created with proper scopes (`propose_plan`, etc.)
**Result**: Full proposal workflow now functional

#### 3. Exercise Progress Logging (400 → 200)
**Issue**: Progress logging failed with validation error
**Root Cause**: Missing required `eventType` field
**Fix**: Added `eventType: "exercise_completed"` to request
**Result**: Progress logs successfully, awards XP, triggers level-ups
