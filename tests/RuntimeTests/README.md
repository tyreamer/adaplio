# Adaplio Runtime Tests

End-to-end integration tests that run against a live API instance to validate authentication and onboarding workflows.

## What These Tests Do

These tests **actually hit a running API** and validate:
- ✅ Client magic link authentication flow
- ✅ Trainer registration and login
- ✅ Token validation and refresh
- ✅ Profile creation and updates
- ✅ Complete onboarding journeys
- ✅ Input validation and security
- ✅ Rate limiting behavior

## Prerequisites

1. **API must be running** on `http://localhost:8080` (or set `API_TEST_URL` environment variable)
2. Database should be in a clean state (or tests create unique users)
3. .NET 8 SDK installed

## Running the Tests

### Run all runtime tests:
```bash
cd tests/RuntimeTests
dotnet test
```

### Run specific test class:
```bash
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~AuthFlowTests"
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~OnboardingFlowTests"
```

### Run with verbose output:
```bash
dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
```

### Run against different API:
```bash
API_TEST_URL=https://your-api.com dotnet test
```

## Test Coverage

### AuthFlowTests (20+ tests)
- **Client Magic Link**: Request, verify, validation
- **Trainer Auth**: Register, login, password validation
- **Token Management**: Validation, refresh, expiration
- **Rate Limiting**: Excessive request handling
- **Security**: Invalid tokens, missing auth

### OnboardingFlowTests (15+ tests)
- **Trainer Onboarding**: Complete registration flow
- **Client Onboarding**: Magic link workflow
- **Profile Completion**: Updates, validation
- **Multi-Step Journeys**: End-to-end user flows
- **Input Validation**: XSS, length limits, format checks

### Main Features Tests (test_main_features.py) - 8 test categories
- **Client Dashboard**: Board, progress summary, gamification stats
- **Trainer Features**: Client list, templates, proposals
- **Exercise Library**: Browse available exercises
- **Plan Template Creation**: Create reusable plan templates
- **Plan Proposal Workflow**: Propose plans, client acceptance
- **Exercise Completion**: Log progress, track adherence
- **Profile Management**: View and update user profiles
- **Analytics**: Usage analytics and events

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Passing Tests Indicate:
- API endpoints are accessible
- Authentication flows work
- Database operations succeed
- Validation rules are enforced
- Security measures are active

### ❌ Failing Tests Reveal:
- Runtime bugs in auth logic
- Database configuration issues
- Missing validation
- CORS problems
- Token generation failures

## CI/CD Integration

Add to GitHub Actions:
```yaml
- name: Start API
  run: |
    cd src/Api/Adaplio.Api
    dotnet run &
    sleep 10

- name: Run Runtime Tests
  run: |
    cd tests/RuntimeTests
    dotnet test --logger "trx;LogFileName=test-results.trx"
  env:
    API_TEST_URL: http://localhost:8080

- name: Stop API
  run: pkill -f Adaplio.Api
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tests fail with "Connection refused"
- Ensure API is running: `cd src/Api/Adaplio.Api && dotnet run`
- Check API port matches (default: 8080)

### Tests fail with 401 Unauthorized
- Check JWT configuration in API
- Verify token generation is working
- Check database has proper tables

### Tests fail with rate limiting
- This is expected behavior
- Tests verify rate limits work
- Clean test data between runs if needed

## Local Development

### Quick test during development:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start API
cd src/Api/Adaplio.Api
dotnet run

# Terminal 2: Run tests
cd tests/RuntimeTests
dotnet watch test
```

### Debug specific failures:
```bash
dotnet test --filter "TrainerRegister_ShouldCreateNewAccount" --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
```
